            discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your

            In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between
            them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any
            provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or
            in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall
            be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the
            Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator
            and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a
            similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location
            mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be
            final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having
            jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action,
            proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and
            Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
            costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate
            all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or
            any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions,
            whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a
            result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that the
            Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
            of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and
            enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by
            the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the
            termination of these Terms and Conditions.

            Long Sky reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate

            thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted
            by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of
            California and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
            venue of courts in California in all disputes arising out of or
            relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in
            any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of
            these Terms, including, without limitation, this section. You agree
            that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency

            contained in this agreement is in derogation of Long Sky's right to
            comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or

            the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by
            a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent
            of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
            continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this
